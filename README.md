# AmazonReviewSummarizer
The goal of this project is to generate a summary of different Amazon product reviews that will help consumers read reviews faster to find the right product. Using the Consumer Reviews of Amazon Products dataset, the project will focus on extraction-based summarization in which we will perform text processing and tokenization, such as extracting important words by creating a bag of words and adding weights while selectively removing the most frequent terms in the review set, to then combine these newly weighted words to form review summaries. The summarization will be evaluated for its precision and accuracy using ROUGE and human evaluation with the same dataset.
