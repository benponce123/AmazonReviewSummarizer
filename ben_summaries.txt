review: Seems alright. Very nice stainless steel design. I like it so far, very well made. I oiled it up good before placing it on my vehicle. It’s difficult to get the locking end on and off. I don’t think there’s a better product out there though, which makes it worth the price.

review: OMG I was under the truck for over a hour wrestling with it! What a piece of junk! Pushing as hard as I could, though, I was not able to get the fuel line off with this tool. It works but like others said, theres nothing easy about getting the old one off.You won’t have any problems disconnecting that AC line. Solid connectors.

review: Excellent seal puller. Long handle to give lots of leverage. This puller works well for what is is designed to do...pull seals. An incredibly easy to use seal puller that is Made In The USA.  Excellent quality and built to last for many years of normal use. It works and is nicely constructed.

review: It's kind of a crap shoot as to whether you'll be entertained or not, but hey, if you're just sitting around trying to kill 20-30 minutes while you're waiting for something else to do, it's worth a shot. It beats watching a blank screen. Not bad. I'll check out the next season soon. I usually enjoy standup comedy and is this is a good show for me.

review: Watched it for Kevin Hart and only Kevin Hart!  He makes me laugh. The best comedy comes from pain and Kevin does his comedy with a huge heart. Great for dinner TV entertainment because of length of each episode. comedy is a matter of taste. this guy was a little funny but there are others that are far funnier than this guy.
