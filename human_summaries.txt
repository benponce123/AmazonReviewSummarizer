review:This is a great mic for vocals. It is more pricey than the SM58, but it is much better in quality. It is sturdy and can withstand a lot of use. The sound quality is extremely clear and picks up sound well without muffled sounds. The Beta58A is worth the price.

asin: B0007Y3XGW
review: These are well built and nice-looking tuners. They install easily without any issues. They are a perfect fit on my guitar. These replace my old tuners. They work great.

asin: B0015RIN6U
review: This tuner is the best tuner. It's everything you could want in a tuner. It is true bypass and silent. Look no further for a tuner pedal. It's display is nice and bright in the darkness. Highly recommended.

asin: B0050CEEIW
review: The cable is a good price. The cable stopped working after using it for a long time. It is used for dynamic microphones. The USB doesn't supply enough power for phantom power. 

asin: B0014IEBM0
review: These speaker look and sound nice for computer moniters. They sound ok, but are not reliable. These have problems with extended use. The speakers have good clarity and volume. There are better quality speakers out there.

review = 'The most comfortable and versatile carrier. Challenging to use. Slings are not very easy on larger women. Son loves this. It pulled hard on my shoulder.'

asin = 'B00005BYUX'
review = 'Cover easily snaps it close washable, BPA-free, slim and portable. Nuby makes great products. Fairly long spoons and worked great. Eight utensils will fit with the lid on the case. Perfect way to store utensils'

review = "Katy Perry's second single 'Teenage Dream' is a blast. Amazing, pop song by Katy Perry and proves that she is the Queen of pop. Vocals are dreadful, the beat is obnoxious, really horrible song and way overplayed. Lack of really striking music. It will always be one of my favorites."

review = 'Fantastic tasting and very nice light snack. Yummy crispy coconut chips. Crunchy, rich, and sweet. Healthy snack food and great in baking, smoothies, ice cream. Strange fat content.'

review = 'Awesome taste but too expensive. Candy is delicious tart and sweet. Allergic to its non-sugar sweetening ingredients. Individually wrapped. Not the same as the sugar sweetened one.'
