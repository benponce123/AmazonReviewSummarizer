review:This is a great mic for vocals. It is more pricey than the SM58, but it is much better in quality. It is sturdy and can withstand a lot of use. The sound quality is extremely clear and picks up sound well without muffled sounds. The Beta58A is worth the price.

review: These are well built and nice-looking tuners. They install easily without any issues. They are a perfect fit on my guitar. These replace my old tuners. They work great.

review: This tuner is the best tuner. It's everything you could want in a tuner. It is true bypass and silent. Look no further for a tuner pedal. It's display is nice and bright in the darkness. Highly recommended.

review: The cable is a good price. The cable stopped working after using it for a long time. It is used for dynamic microphones. The USB doesn't supply enough power for phantom power.

review: These speaker look and sound nice for computer moniters. They sound ok, but are not reliable. These have problems with extended use. The speakers have good clarity and volume. There are better quality speakers out there.
